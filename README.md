Get-Filehash is an easy-to-use program with a modern-looking GUI and an easily accessible interface. It makes checking the hash values of a file easy and adds a few features, like stacking up to 99 hash values below each other for easier comparison.
It automatically compares hash values of files and if the values are the same, they are marked with coresponding numbers. When the hash value is checked, you see what algorithm it has used to check the value, the hash value of a file, 
and the directory where the file is placed.
